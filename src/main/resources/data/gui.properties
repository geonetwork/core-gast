1=GeoNetwork must be stopped in order to execute this operation
2=GeoNetwork must be restarted in order to make changes effective
3=GeoNetwork must be running in order to execute this operation
4=Configuration
7=Save
8=Jetty must be restarted in order to make the changes effective.
9=DBMS
10=DBMS configuration
11=	This panel allows you to change the DBMS you want to connect to.\
				Here you can change only the configuration. You have also to create\
				the schema and populate the database. You can do that through\
				the 'database/setup' panel. If you select the embedded database\
				and its data files are not there (for example because you just\
				checked out from the subversion repository), the 'save' button \
				will also create them and generate a new random account.
12=Management
13=Import
14=Metadata import
15=This panel lets you reimport a previouly exported set\
				of metadata/data. The import is not destructive, in the\
				sense that new records will be created. So, make sure\
				to have an empty database if you don't want metadata\
				overlap.
16=Uses MEF facilities so GeoNetwork must be running.
17=Export
18=Metadata export
19=This panel lets you export your metadata/data from GeoNetwork\ 
				into a folder of your file system. There will be one file\
				for each metadata/data in MEF format.
20=Metadata Sync
21=Metadata synchronization
22=Each metadata contains links to the GeoNetwork's server in\
				order to allow resource retrieval. If you change the server's\
				address and port from the web interface, these links will break.\
				This panel simply scans all metadata and fixes these links.
23=Synchronize
24=All local metadata must be scanned and changed so there must not\
				be records under editing.
25=115 to 139
26=ISO 19115 to 19139 conversion
27=Prior to version 2.1, GeoNetwork managed only the old ISO 19115\
				metadata format (the one with short names). Starting from\
				version 2.1 you can use the new ISO 19139 format, which is\
				the XML encoding of the ISO 19115:2003 spec.\
				This panel lets you convert your old metadata in ISO 19115\
				format to the new one.
28=Convert
29=GeoNetwork could even be running but maybe it is better if it is stopped.
30=Database
31=Setup
32=Database setup
33=Once you have configured your DBMS in the 'configuration/dbms' \
				panel, you have to use this panel to create tables and fill\
				them with initial data.
34=Obviously GeoNetwork cannot be running while the database gets built.
35=Sample data
36=Sample data and metadata
37=There are some sample metadata that you can import into your\
				GeoNetwork after setup. These are provided just to experiment\
				the features and the user interface.\
				You can even import the same metadata several times in order to\
				fill your database for stress tests.
38=Uses MEF facilities so GeoNetwork must be running.
39=Migration
40=Old installation
41=Migrate an old GeoNetwork
42=This panel allows you to migrate metadata from an old GeoNetwork 2.0.x\
				installation. This procedure migrates the database content. After \
				this stage, you will probably need to setup some parameters into \
				the config.xml file (like dataDir). Other parameters (like proxy\
				settings) must be changed using the web interface. Harvested\
				metadata are not migrated. When migrating, both old and new nodes MUST NOT \
				be started. If you use Tomcat and you have used only the geonetwork's \
				'web' folder you have to select the GeoNetwork's web app folder inside Tomcat.
43=Migrate
44=GeoNetwork must be stopped when the database is being migrated.
45=GeoNetwork must be restarted in order to make the changes effective.
46=Uses MEF facilities so GeoNetwork must be running.
47=Old GeoSource
48=Migrate an old GeoSource
49=This panel allows you to migrate metadata from GeoSource v1.x\
				installation. This procedure migrates the database content. After \
				this stage, you will probably need to setup some parameters into \
				the config.xml file (like dataDir). Other parameters (like proxy\
				settings) must be changed using the web interface. Harvested\
				metadata are not migrated. When migrating, both old and new nodes MUST NOT \
				be started. If you use Tomcat and you have used only the geonetwork's \
				'web' folder you have to select the GeoNetwork's web app folder inside Tomcat.
50=*** WARNING *** Here you can change your installation's site ID \
				but you should not do this by hand, unless you are migrating \
				from a previous installation
51=Site ID
52=Site ID change
